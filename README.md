# Deprecation Warning
This package is no longer under active development.  For updated and supported versions of this package, please see:
 * [rail_grasp_calculation](https://github.com/gt-rail/rail_grasp_calculation): Standalone meta-package for grasp pose clustering and heuristic calculation, as well as messages for connecting to grasp samplers and other grasp ranking methods (the package itself is agnostic to where the source of the grasp poses)
 * [rail_agile](https://github.com/gt-rail/rail_agile): adapted [AGILE_grasp](https://github.com/atenpas/agile_grasp) package exposing some functionality as ROS action servers, for use with [rail_grasp_calculation](https://github.com/gt-rail/rail_grasp_calculation)

# rail_agile_grasp
Metapackage for the heuristic-based AGILE grasp detector and classifier. Includes the original AGILE package, the heuristic classifier package, and other supporting functionality.  This metapackage includes the grasp calculator for the Point-and-Click method for 6-DoF end-effector positioning described in [A Comparison of Remote Robot Teleoperation Interfaces for General Object Manipulation](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3020249), published in HRI 2017.

## Description
This metapackage extends AGILE grasp to use heuristic-based grasp evaluation in place of AGILE's grasp classifier.  Development of this package included adding extra ROS messages, services, and actionlib to the original AGILE code to facilitate communication with the heurist-based evaluator.  Also included are additional packages potentially useful for testing and deployment.

## agile_grasp_base
This is the original agile grasp package, modified with an action server to allow grasps to be found on demand.  More details on the functionality of this package can be found in the main [AGILE_grasp](https://github.com/atenpas/agile_grasp), on which this was based.

## rail_agile_grasp_msgs
This package contains action definitions, messages, and services used throughout the metapackage.  For more details, check the message definitions themselves.

## rail_agile_nodes
The primary node of this package, [grasp_sampler](#grasp_sampler), implements grasp clustering and rating based on a set of heuristics designed to select effective grasps for man-made objects.  More details on the heuristics can be found in our paper, A Comparison of Remote Robot Teleoperation Interfaces for General Object Manipulation, to be published in HRI2017.

The package also includes optional supporting nodes for filtering point clouds, creating clickable point clouds via interactive marker server, and interleaving point clouds from multiple sources.  Details of each node can be found below.

### grasp_sampler
This node performs grasp candidate evaluation by evaluating a set of heuristics on grasp poses sampled from the grasp hypotheses determined by the AGILE_grasp base package.  Relevant parameters, action servers, topics, and services are as follows:

   * `remove_table`(boolean, false)  
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; option to remove the dominant plane from the point cloud within the given workspace before calculating the object orientaion heuristic; it's recommended to set this to true if the grasps are being used for tabletop pick-and-place applications.

## Installation
Clone the package into your catkin workspace and build it as follows:
```bash
cd (your catkin workspace)/src
git clone https://github.com/GT-RAIL/rail_agile_grasp.git
cd ..
catkin_make
```

## Startup
The `rail_agile_nodes` package contains two launch files that will bring up the main functionality of the package.  `find_grasps.launch` will run the base AGILE code and the `grasp_sampler` node for sampling and ranking the AGILE hypotheses by heuristics.  It is run as follows:
```bash
roslaunch rail_agile_nodes find_grasps.launch
```

`two_cameras.launch` will run the same thing, but will launch two depth cameras and add the intermediate step of point cloud interleaving.
```bash
roslaunch rail_agile_nodes two_cameras.launch
```

Supporting nodes can be run individually using `rosrun`.
